The number of placed students is not shared by the institute; however, the average package of KCC is 4 to 5 LPA, which is offered by different companies like Jellyfish, Nucleus Software.

The top recruiting companies are Flipkart, Infosys, Ola, etc. Almost every student got internships in companies like Wipro, Infosys, etc.\n\nInfrastructure: The institutes boast excellent infrastructure, with well-equipped labs, individual seminar halls on each floor, well-ventilated classrooms, and a two-story library. The hostel facilities are also exceptional, providing students with access to a variety of indoor and outdoor sports. The quality of food is consistently good, with a frequently changing menu. Additionally, medical facilities are available for students in need of assistance or who become ill.\n\nFaculty: Teachers are very knowledgeable and are always ready to help students with any case or doubt. The institute is affiliated with AKTU. This makes the curriculum more relevant and makes the students industry-ready. The semester exams are quite difficult in the college comparatively.\n\nOther: B.Tech in Computer Science (Data Science) offers one of the best job opportunities to date, making it a suitable course for any engineering student. The institution must organise more teachfests. However, annual festivals are organised every year. And the social life of the students is also very good on the college campus."

This suggests that JIMS may enjoy a stronger reputation according to student feedback. Additionally, JIMS Greater Noida offers a variety of programs in engineering, business administration, computer applications, and other fields, which are recognized and accredited by relevant regulatory authorities such as AICTE, BCI, and NCTE. It has been consistently ranked highly in certain categories, particularly in BBA and BCA, by several ranking organizations. Furthermore, JIMS Greater Noida boasts strong industry partnerships and high placement rates, with an average annual package of approximately INR 4.74 lakh and a highest CTC of INR 17 lakh per annum.

Companies like TCS, INFOSYS, BYJUS, etc., recruit placements from our college. Internship basically depends from person to person, as per their interest and dedication towards the subject. Contact with seniors and faculty members is helpful as the faculty is really good.\n\nInfrastructure: The infrastructure of the college is really nice. Air-conditioned classrooms and classes have projectors as well. Chairs and tables in the class as well as in the canteen are comfortable. The library of the college is well-equipped with computer systems and provides a wide variety of books. The campus is equipped with Wi-Fi. A new computer lab is made in the college with well-equipped the latest systems in it. The systems have all the software and compilers installed for the coders like- Visual Studio Code 2022, Turbo, etc. An open amphitheater is there for the students where we can have group discussions.\n\nFaculty: The college provides with knowledgeable faculty. Classes are conducted properly, and the teachers teach with interest. Doubt sessions with the teachers can be held in person during the break schedule. The college is GSSIPU affiliated, so the same curriculum is followed in our college. Teachers complete the course on time, and mid-sem question papers are from the university only. The mid-sem checking is done internally and is done in a way to prepare the students for the end-sem exams. The difficulty of semester exams depends on the student.\n\nOther: The course provides knowledge in various fields like mechanics, workshop, Physics, mathematics, etc. Communication Skills is the most important subject as it teaches students how to communicate during interviews. Events like hackathons, blind coding, mastermind, treasure hunts, and navras are conducted, bringing a diverse range of activities from various fields. Campus surroundings are also good. The campus is in the knowledge park, which itself is an area filled with knowledge. University fests like Anugoonj and Celebrity Night are also conducted.",

I have joined this college solely for degree purposes.\n\nInfrastructure: This college has only one boys hostel on its campus, accommodating around 50 to 100 boys from different departments. On paper, it is mentioned that these hostels offer good 3-time food facilities with Wi-Fi and AC, but I cannot confirm from personal experience as I have never been there.\n\nFaculty: The faculty of this college is supportive and motivating. While I can't speak for all faculty members, in my department, I've found them to possess vast knowledge about their subjects and be genuinely supportive. So, yes, the faculty members in this college are indeed supportive and nice.\n\nOther: No"

I know of my friend's package, which is INR 2 LPA. Airtel and Infosys are top recruiting companies. Software developer, tester, software engineer, web developer, and full stack developer are all roles offered in our course. According to the knowledge students gain after college, they get the job.\n\nInfrastructure: Infrastructure-wise, the college is good and has good hostel facilities with all the services. Wi-Fi, lab, classroom, library—everything is good. One thing I want to highlight here about libraries is that their rules are not good. They say you cannot sit in the library during class time, and the good books are placed in the reference section and we cannot issue them. That is not good.\n\nFaculty: Yes, teachers support and help students perform well. The course curriculum is not relevant and doesn't make the students industry-ready, as there is a lot to learn about it, including its history. In my opinion, course curriculum should be updated every year in order to keep up with technological advances and industry demands.\n\nOther: CSE is a demanding field in today's market. And I also like to study computers. I'd like to see some changes, such as only taking two or three exams per semester instead of five or six. And introduce practical implementations of methods we read about in books. So that students can be student-ready. Events happen here, like the Freshers Welcome Party. Also, scholarships are provided by the government through IP University."

                    "IILM University, Greater Noida's B.Tech CSE placements receive mixed reviews, with both promising aspects and drawbacks to consider. Here's a breakdown:Positives:High Average Salary: The reported average salary for CSE graduates at IILM is considered decent, ranging between 5-7 LPA (varying sources), potentially making it competitive in the region.Reputed Companies: IILM claims to have placed graduates in well-known IT companies like Infosys, Wipro, TCS, etc., which could provide valuable experience and career growth opportunities.Dedicated Placement Cell: The university has a dedicated placement cell that assists students with resume building, interview preparation, and connecting with potential employers.Negatives:Focus on Mass Recruiters: While reputed companies are mentioned, some reviews suggest a heavy focus on mass recruiters. This can limit opportunities for specialisation and potentially lead to lower starting salaries for high-performing graduates.Location: Greater Noida's distance from major IT hubs like Gurgaon or Bangalore might affect access to certain job opportunities, although some companies do conduct campus placements at IILM.Overall:IILM's B.Tech CSE placements offer some promise, with decent average salaries and the potential to enter renowned companies. However, the lack of detailed placement data and a possible strong reliance on mass recruiters raise concerns about the program's overall placement effectiveness and opportunities for higher-paying roles.To make an informed decision, consider these additional points:Specific Program Focus: Research the specialisation (s) offered within the B.Tech CSE programme at IILM, as this can impact placement opportunities.Alumni Reviews: Connect with IILM CSE alumni through online platforms or LinkedIn to get firsthand insights on their placement experiences.Compare with other Universities: Evaluate placement data and reputation of CSE programs at other universities you're considering.Remember, placement is just one factor to consider when choosing a university.
